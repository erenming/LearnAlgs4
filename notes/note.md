## 贪心算法

- 多用于最优解的求解
- Greedy algorithms take all of the data in a particular problem, and then set a rule for which elements to add to the solution at each step of the algorithm. 
- 满足以下两个条件，可考虑用贪心算法
    1. **Greedy choice property**: A global (overall) optimal solution can be reached by choosing the optimal choice at each step.
    2. **Optimal substructure**: A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the entire problem contains the optimal solutions to the sub-problems.
